# 🏄‍♂️ Abbas Ibragimov

**`Software Engineer | React, Next, TypeScript`**

I am a results-driven frontend developer with a strong focus on building functional, user-friendly, and visually appealing web applications. With expertise in React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, I specialize in turning complex Figma designs into responsive, high-performance user interfaces. Occasionally, I take on full-stack projects, leveraging Node.js, Express, and SQL/NOSQL databases to deliver end-to-end solutions.
